# Godot Chess Prototype
This is a simple prototype chess game I made in Godot. It is by no means complete, it's just enough functionality to pass along the idea of a chess game.

## Missing Features
- While the King cannot move into check, there is nothing that forces players to protect their king from check.
- Also checkmate is not implemented, so there is no win condition.

## What can you do?
- You can use this code however you want. (The LICENSE file basically just says that in legal-speak.)
- I try to write code that's as easy as possible to understand, so hopefully you can learn something from this project and easily expand it however you desire!

## Who am I?
- I'm Daniel from Saber C++
